The data includes all types of collisions and the timeframe is from 2004 to Present.\n\n**TOTAL VARIABLES:** The initial data has **36 Predictor Variables** and one Target Variable which is **SEVERITY CODE** The dataset contains data on accident which took place, severity of it and the values of various parameters at the time of accident.\n\nThe variables are in the format: Variable Name- Description (Type)\n\n1. OBJECTID - ESRI unique identifier (Object ID)\n2. SHAPE - ESRI geometry field (Geometry)\n3. INCKEY - A unique key for the incident (Long)\n4. COLDETKEY - Secondary key for the incident (Long)\n5. ADDRTYPE - Collision address type (Text, 12) - Can be one of (Alley, Block, Intersection)\n6. INTKEY - Key that corresponds to the intersection associated with a collision (Double)\n7. LOCATION - Description of the general location of the collision (Text, 255)\n8. SEVERITYCODE -A code that corresponds to the severity of the collision (Text, 100) - Can be one of (1,2)\n9. SEVERITYDESC - A detailed description of the severity of the collision (Text)\n10.\tEXCEPTRSNCODE - (Text , 10)\n11.\tEXCEPTRSNDESC - (Text , 300)\n12.\tCOLLISIONTYPE - Collision type (Text, 300)\n13.\tPERSONCOUNT - The total number of people involved in the collision (Double)\n14.\tPEDCOUNT - The number of pedestrians involved in the collision. (Double)\n15.\tPEDCYLCOUNT - The number of bicycles involved in the collision. (Double)\n16.\tVEHCOUNT - The number of vehicles involved in the collision. (Double)\n17.\tINJURIES - The number of total injuries in the collision. (Double) \n18.\tSERIOUSINJURIES - The number of serious injuries in the collision. (Double)\n19.\tFATALITIES - The number of fatalities in the collision. (Double) \n20.\tINCDATE - The date of the incident.(Date)\n21.\tINCDTTM - The date and time of the incident.(Text, 30)\n22.\tJUNCTIONTYPE - Category of junction at which collision took place (Text, 300)\n23.\tSDOT_COLCODE - A code given to the collision by SDOT.(Text,10) \n24.\tSDOT_COLDESC - A description of the collision corresponding to the collision code.(Text,300)\n25.\tINATTENTIONIND - Whether or not collision was due to inattention.(Y/N)(Text, 1)\n26.\tUNDERINFL - Whether or not a driver involved was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. (Text, 10)\n27.\tWEATHER - A description of the weather conditions during the time of the collision.(Text, 300)\n28.\tROADCOND - The condition of the road during the collision.(Text, 300)\n29.\tLIGHTCOND - The light conditions during the collision.(Text, 300)\n30.\tPEDROWNOTGRNT - Whether or not the pedestrian right of way was not granted. (Y/N) (Text, 1)\n31.\tSDOTCOLNUM - A number given to the collision by SDOT.(Text, 10)\n32.\tSPEEDING - Whether or not speeding was a factor in the collision. (Y/N) (Text, 1)\n33.\tST_COLCODE - A code provided by the state that describes the collision. (Text, 10)\n34.\tST_COLDESC - A description that corresponds to the state\u2019s coding designation.(Text 300)\n35.\tSEGLANEKEY - A key for the lane segment in which the collision occurred.(Long)\n36.\tCROSSWALKKEY - A key for the crosswalk at which the collision occurred.(Long)\n37.\tHITPARKEDCAR - Whether or not the collision involved hitting a parked car. (Y/N) (Text, 1)  \n"
